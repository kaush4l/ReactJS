## TODO list
### Immediate
* Redisign the website to be as simple as possible.
* A Home page with a theme or a gif picture like [this](https://christopher.su/)
* Update the experiences and projects
### Overkill
* Try moving the content to some cloud services so that I can just update there and page loads the data
* Try adding all the side projects so that they are easily accessible
* Make a generic theme and also try to host any material so that it can be shared
