| _*Indigo Application*_ | Developer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| `June 2018` | Started a full stack application using Spring Boot, ReactJS, MongoDB, Axios, and REST Services. The application is a basic application which takes date from REST services and stores them in the database using the controller. The application uses all the latest technologies to keep the structure up to date. The project will can be moulded basing on the ideas acquired.
