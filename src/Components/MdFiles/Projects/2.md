| `May 2016` | LZW is compression algorithm which compresses any dataset without any prior knowledge on the dataset. The sample dataset achieved a compression ratio of 0.38. The higher the redundancy, the higher the ratio. Using this algorithm we can compress any given data to get compressed files. [_*Project*_](https://github.com/kaush4l/LZW-Compression). |
