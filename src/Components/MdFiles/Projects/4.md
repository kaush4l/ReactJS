| _*Movie Recommendation System*_ | Hadoop developer |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| `December 2016` | A movie recommender system was written in Hadoop MapReduce framework using the publicly available movie lens dataset. We used a tweaked version of Jaccard coefficiency to find the user-user similarity and then suggest movie based on the most similar user. The project was written in Hadoop MapReduce(Java) and Apache Spark(Python). [_*Link to project*_](https://github.com/kaush4l/MovieLens-Movie-Recommander-system).
