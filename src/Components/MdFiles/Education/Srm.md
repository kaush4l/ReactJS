| `July 2011 - May 2015` | Learning has always been my interest. But this is the place that my interest turned towards coding and found passion in doing it. Various courses that I had taken have helped me lean many new things. Courses like Cryptography zealed my interest in understanding logics and findings ways of solving problems. The best things I learned was to understand things quickly. I was exposed to different tasks which helped me in moulding for a fast paced environment. I leaned many things and have been trying to make myslef even better. Everyday is a new challenge and a new day to lean things. |
